                <h2>SEE NO EVIL</h2>
                <section class="content">I became fascinated with the concept of speak no, see no, hear no evil. And - and the
                    actual depiction of three wise monkeys. And I began collecting it over the years. And I kind of
                    figured that I might be the - the fourth monkey, the feel no evil monkey.

                    The monkey wears an expression of seriousness which would do credit to any college student, but the
                    monkey is serious because he itches.
